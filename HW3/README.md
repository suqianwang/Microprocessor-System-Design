Write a decoder for PWM in C. Your program should read the input from the file “input4.txt”, and output the result to the file “output4.txt”. The input file begins with a single number, which indicates the number of time slots in T seconds. (Recall that one value is transmitted every T seconds.) Following the number is a sequence of binary numbers (either 0 or 1), separated by space. Your program should output the sequence of transmitted values. Please remember to provide sufficient comments to explain your decoder.
